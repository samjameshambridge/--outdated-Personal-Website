This project was written with:

- Bootstrap

## Status

Project is: \_finished.

This site is no longer used and has been replaced with a React Application hosted on the same domain (https://samjameshambridge.com). The github repo for the new site can be found at: https://github.com/samjameshambridge/personal-website-v2.

## Inspiration

When I started teaching myself Front End Development, I designed and created this website to showcase my emerging portfolio to potential employers.

The aim was to create a website which felt original and simple. I didn't want to have too many effects and animations, i wanted to it to be clear and accessible.
