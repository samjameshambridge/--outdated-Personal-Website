## Technologies
This project is written with:
* Javascript
* Bootstrap
* Jquery

## Status

Project is: _finished.

Although I will make additions and changes along the way as my skills and projects change. This website is deployed and considered finished.

## Inspiration

I wanted to make a website which felt fairly minimalist, relaxed and simple. I also didn't want to have a tonne of effects and animations, I just wanted it do be engaging.
