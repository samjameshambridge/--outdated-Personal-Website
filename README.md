## Status

Project is: _finished.

Although I will make additions and changes along the way as my skills and projects change. This website is deployed and considered finished.

## Inspiration

After beginning to write a lot of my own projects, I wanted a website which I could use to display and showcase them.

The aim was to create a website which felt fairly original and simple. I didn't want to have too many effects and animations, i wanted to it to be clear and accessible.
